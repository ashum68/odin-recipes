<p>Wash the rice three times. Make sure to pour out the starchy water and use fresh water each time. Since the rice will be stir fried, cook the rice with slightly less water. That way, the rice will be firmer. Cook the rice in the rice cooker or with alternative methods. If you want to cook with American rice, note that it's harder and therefore requires more water. The end result should be a firm grain that's been cooked through, but not soggy or too wet for stir frying. Prepare ingredients. Dice carrots into medium-sized cubes. Chop scallions into medium-sized pieces. Make sure to separate the white parts from the green parts. Dice char siu into medium-sized cubes. Halve the shrimps lengthwise. Crack and beat the eggs in a bowl. Add salt and mix. Cook ingredients. In a medium-sized pot, add water and bring to a boil. Once boiling, add the carrots and peas. Cook for 30 to 40 seconds. Add the shrimp and let everything cook for 3 minutes. Strain and set aside. Stir fry rice and eggs. Heat up the wok to high heat for one minute before adding oil. The oil is ready when you see that it is rippling. Right before frying, add salt and mix them into the eggs. Pour the eggs into the wok and cook for only 10 to 15 seconds before adding the cooked rice. Take your time while cooking the rice with the eggs. Make sure to break up the eggs and the rice. When you hear that crackling, you know you have wok hei. If you notice that your rice is sticking together, that means that your wok is not hot enough or you cooked the rice with too much water. Another possibility is that the rice you are using is too soft. If that is the case, cook the rice the day before and leave it in the refrigerator overnight. Stir fry main ingredients. After 2.5 to 3 minutes of frying the rice and eggs on high heat, turn down the heat and add salt and light soy sauce. Move the rice to the sides of the wok, leaving the center empty to add the char siu to cook. Once the char siu has started to cook, mix it into the rice and cook for 1.5 minutes. Add the vegetables and shrimps. Turn the heat to high, mix everything together, and add oil to make the rice glisten. Add the scallions, mix, and take off the heat.</p>
